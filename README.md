prediction with logistic regression
This project involves extensive data cleaning, which involves focusing on segregating feild values, including both survived and unsurvived.
This project involves cleanin g and normalising data to remove noise, which is crucial for accurate analytics.
I utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to handle data manipulation and analysis efficiently.
Additionally I applied machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Sklearn to predict outcomes and identify missing data.
